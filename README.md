# English-to-French-Translator-with-LSTM---10th-NOV-21

In this hands-on project, we will train a Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM) to perform English to French translation. This project could be practically used as a communication tool to help travelers or people who are settling into a new country.

                      Objectives
In this course, we are going to focus on the following learning objectives:

Apply python libraries to import and visualize datasets

Perform exploratory data analysis and plot word-cloud

Perform text data cleaning such as removing punctuation and stop words

Understand the concept of tokenizer.

Perform tokenizing and padding on text corpus to feed the deep learning model.

Understand the theory and intuition behind Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM

Build and train the deep learning model

Access the performance of the trained model
